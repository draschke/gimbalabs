## What are the objectives/outcomes of Playground?
_Experience is Learning_
1. Build network and relationships
2. Build expertise
3. Build dapps and tools

## What are the objectives of this web page? (gimbalabs.com/playground) 
We want to send a coherent message to:
- Potential devs - anyone who wants to grows skills while contributing to projects
- Potential builders - anyone who has an idea and wants to build on Cardano
- Potential clients - entrepreneurs and business leaders who want to launch projects:
	- Start ups & Catalyst Proposals
	⁃ Legacy organizations

## How do we do it?
Show the thread from the open "Playground" to Project Based Learning and then to real outcomes. Provide a brief, understandable definition that highlights the value of this method, including technical and social challenges to adoption. Illustrate the dynamics of a playground, communicating the essential spirit of "YOU" in action, involved, accountable.

## What is Playground?

### Weekly Meeting
At our weekly meeting we discuss big ideas and make space for people to propose new projects. This meeting serves a starting point, by providing a frame for project-based, experiential learning. The conversations that happen in our weekly serve as an end in themselves, because all participants cultivate a deeper understanding of key ideas - and we strive to make space for the work to take root beyond these meetings.

### A Collaborative Space & Problem-Sensing Network
The Gimbalabs Playground community is a network of problem solvers.

### A Process for Launching Projects
A space for self-organizing project teams, with Organizer, Contributor, and Apprentice roles
(See Playground Process)

### A Growing Array of Projects and a Growing Library of Tools
When we work on projects, we recognize the need for new tools. By completing projects, we create new tools. In turn, these new tools inspire new opportunities to solve additional problems, launching new projects.

### Social, Collaborative Infrastructure
A gimbal is a balancing device. To support projects launching on Catalyst or within existing communities and organizations, the Playground helps to create social infrastructure for making the most of all that the Cardano protocol now makes possible.

As we explore what is possible, we also define roles. This process of way-finding is ongoing and cyclical. When someone attends a Playground session, joins a project and helps to see that project through, they might return later to share what they’ve accomplished, and then to find a new role. The reward for solving problems successfully is the opportunity to solve more problems, to take on new projects. This logic is currently informing the tokenomics structure of the gimbal token.

## Who is the Playground For?

### Developers who want to build and need 
- Tools: for everyone who has an idea and needs the infrastructure to build it. This is a bridge from Playground to Dandelion. Open source tools:  learn and create tools, ongoing development of tools emerging from and required by projectsthe playground to be leveraged for any project coming to playground; 
- Understanding of how and when the Cardano protocol is an applicable tool. Understanding what problems Cardano solves.
- Opportunities to contribute: developer who wants to build on blockchain. We need your (front-end, UX/UI) skills to build projects, and you learn how to incorporate blockchain tech into your stack. 
- A team: Playground provides a starting point to build relationships

### Community Members and Entrepreneurs who need
- Sense-making
- Problem Sensing

### Businesses who need
- support with onboarding to Cardano

## How does Gimbalabs Playground support the Mission and Vision of Gimbalabs?

(“Our ethos is simple.”)

Our mission is to mobilize everyone in the Cardano community by creating tools and real-world use cases that ignite the public imagination and facilitate adoption.

We envision a world where as many people as possible are empowered to solve problems using the Cardano protocol.

To deliver on our mission takes equal commitment to technical and social solutions.

To achieve our vision, we must be able to create access points - to show people - what the Cardano protocol is and what it can do.

We are not alone in this work - it’s happening across the Cardano ecosystem, and there are many ways to approach it.

We are building one space among many for it to happen, and our focus is on education before marketing. Utility before hype. If we build tools that ought to exist, then over time people will get it. This is the essence of experiential learning, of project-based and problem-based learning.

The Gimbalabs Playground makes little distinction between learning and doing. — The experience IS the learning!

The Gimbalabs Playground model is flexible and scalable. It can be used by groups of like-minded people, by local communities, and by businesses. The Gimbalabs Playground model makes space for people to learn by doing, and the model assumes abundance: our focus is not on capturing value, but on creating it, and letting that value flow freely within and beyond Gimbalabs.

The open door of Playground is about building the future we want to see. The more people who can get involved, the more perspectives (social, economic, geographic, tech/non-tech) we can make space for, the better the ideas we’ll have. Cardano is so big that we’re going to need all sorts of people to understand and be able to communicate its value to different stakeholders.

## Why do we call it “Playground”? 
What happens on a Playground?

Playgrounds are about more than just “play”. New technology means we can all think like children: curious, uninhibited, open.

Playgrounds are collaborative and inclusive, and also make space for competition and flexible grouping.

Play can be serious

Play is how we find out who we are, what we stand for, who our friends are.

We develop a world view, and sense of right and wrong.

We develop skills and the ability to collaborate.


## Shared Sense Making and High Level Planning

The idea of a distributed executive, or it’s a little bit like a board of directors. With open, opt-in participation.

Lately, we’ve been using Playground sessions a bit differently. To what extent is this a current trend? To what extent is it a change in course? For example, if this kind of meeting is producing new value, and we bring in Sidney for example to join the tokenomics conversation, then maybe that says something different about what Playground should be.

### Bring your reality 
As humans, we all recognize unique problems in our lives and in our communities. At Gimbalabs, we know that problems are the building blocks of projects. The Playground makes space for people to collaboratively identify problems worth solving.

### Bring your idea
Your idea is yours - so what will it take to bring it to life? At Playground we take this question very seriously, and we dig deep to learn as much as we can. Sometimes, the answers surprise us. As we make progress, relationships form, and from there, teams.

### Learn by doing
We also know that the best way to learn is by taking action. That’s why we’re passionate about project-based learning. The Playground is where we self-organize into teams that turn ideas into action, providing a space for anyone to learn.

### Level up on your terms
All of us bring different experiences, talents, and skills to Playground. Are you an aspiring developer looking for a welcoming place to start? Do you seek a better understanding of how Cardano can help solve real problems? However you might like to grow, Playground provides a space to start your learning journey.

## Learning and Contributing to Tools

This grounds our sense making work.

### The Playground Process: Launching Projects

- Targeted Dapps
- Tools and Infrastructure

Throughout, we seek to equip as many people as possible to be able to better support projects, according to the strengths that each can contribute. This means more than just building a product. It means understanding what we can accomplish in the real world, the implications of new layers of technology.

Of course we also emphasize the technology. This is how Playground connects to Dandelion. 

## Playground Roles
1. Organizer
2. Contributor
3. Apprentice

Role —> Learns —> Contributes —> Outcomes —> Repeat

Role —> Contributes —> Learns —> New ideas…

### Contributing while learning
Not relying on or requiring prior credentials - taking whoever shows up and providing opportunities to contribute.

Where we’re headed: gradually increasing the scope of the Playground cycle.

### Outcomes: More than “Products”
Relationships and shared understanding are an end in themselves. See Sense Making and Problem Sensing

- Some tools are free and open source
- Some tools are paid services (served by Dandelion?)

### Reflection: Why has it been so hard to write the Playground page copy? 

Part of the reason this has been hard is that we talk about how we’re supporting developers, but that’s not really what Playground has done so far. In reality, Playground is more about bringing all different sorts of stakeholders together and making sense of big ideas. This is the value that we’re capturing in the Playground sessions. 

Of course, it’s a goal for Playground to produce that tooling that we talk about. So how should we treat this goal? Is it a nice guiding principle that we hold loosely and see where it takes us? Or is it an essential outcome that we must do a better job pursuing?
