# What did we build in September, 2021?

Each month, the Plutus Project-Based Learning team gives ourselves a list of learning tasks to accomplish. Below, you can see the tasks we completed in September. 

## Task 00: Start Here - get Plutus Starter up and running
### What we assigned ourselves:
- A basic example of how we'll interact with the Plutus Application Backend (PAB) in a web-based dapp
- [Official Plutus Starter Repo from IOHK](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-starter)
- You can use the Plutus Starter project as a starting point for what you'll see in the following tasks.

## Task 01a: Interact with a basic contract through an endpoint.
### What we assigned ourselves:
- What is the minimal contract we can use to demonstrate interaction with a contract via a local endpoint?
- Task: implement the "Gift" contract from Lecture 2 of Plutus Pioneers, in a way that we can interact with it via the PAB

## Task 01b: Parameterized "Grab"
### What we assigned ourselves:
- Task: create a parameterized version of the Grab endpoint and practice accessing it via `curl`
- [Video Documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeZE5MAjFTI)
- [Public Repository](https://github.com/eselkin/param-pb-pab)

## Task 02: Deliver an Authentication NFT to a Wallet
### What we assigned ourselves:
- Review Lecture 5 and build the simplest possible interaction point for getting something like an auth-nft into a simulated wallet.
- We can implement what we saw in Lecture 5. The goal is for an end user to obtain an authentication token by interacting with a web front-end.

- [Simple NFT Minter Front End](https://github.com/SamJeffrey8/simple-nft-minter-site)


## Task 03: Use an Authentication NFT to access Encrypted Information
### What we assigned ourselves:
- Use an NFT as an authentication token for some privileged access
