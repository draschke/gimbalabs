## Gimbalabs Initiatives
# Experiment #2: Token-Based Incentive Structures

How can we use a native asset on Cardano to create stability and predictability while maintaining a high level of flexibility and autonomy for all contributors?

Our goal is to get stuff done and build toward full time work for anyone who can contribute. Internal work plays a role, and so does cultivating other Catalyst projects.

## Coming soon: Gimbal Pool
