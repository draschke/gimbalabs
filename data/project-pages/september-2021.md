# September

Results of our first month of work.

## What to include:
1. Video of recent meeting
2. How to get involved, how to start - via Discord, via participation, via contribution
3. Link to GitLab, Miro -- OSS everything!

Should learn, tinker, participate be tags?

Figure out how to embed html - read remark docs
