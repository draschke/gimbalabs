Just in case you haven't seen this, here's a video that will show you what's going on under the hood when a transaction is build, signed, and submitted on the Cardano blockchain. This is the essential functionality behind everything else that happens when users interact with Cardano, and if you understand it, then you'll be able to get a better grasp on why the buzz has been about "concurrency" for the last few days.
